# 1. Project Introduction
Road traffic and safety have become one of the major problems in people's safety concern. According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565684), the annual road traffic deaths has reached 1.35 million in 2018, which makes road accident the leading killer of people aged from 5 to 29 years. In the UK, more than xxx traffic accidents have caused xxx casualties from 2005 to 2019. Understanding and projecting the trend of growth (decrease) about the number of traffic accidents, could raise the awareness of the general population and call for collaborative effort to address this problem.

In this project, we try to explore the Road Safety Data from the Department of Transport in the UK. The dataset accurately presents the time, location, police force, vehicles and number of citizens involved in every accident, and it is publicly available at https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data. We will try to capture the trend of accidental cases with a xxxx model, and provide statistical results in a Bayesian perspective. Concretely, we will study the accidents in the 6 representative areas: Metropolitan Police, Cumbria, Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Cheshire.
